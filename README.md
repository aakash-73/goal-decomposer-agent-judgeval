# Goal Decomposer Agent

A terminal-based AI agent that breaks down high-level goals into actionable steps using **Groq** or **OpenAI**, and then **evaluates** the generated plan using **Judgeval**'s `FaithfulnessScorer`.

---

##  Features

-  Goal decomposition using **Groq (LLaMA 3.3 70B)** or **OpenAI GPT-4.1**
-  Terminal prompt + automatic JSON step formatting
-  Evaluates output with `FaithfulnessScorer`
-  Traced and logged with **Judgeval**
-  Modular and easy to extend with other models

## Setup Instructions

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/goal-decomposer-agent.git
cd goal-decomposer-agent
```

### Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate       # Windows
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Set up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
JUDGMENT_API_KEY=your_judgment_api_key
JUDGMENT_ORG_KEY=your_judgment_org_key
```

## Running the Program

To launch the goal decomposer:

```bash
python main.py
```

You‚Äôll be asked to:

- Select the API provider (Groq or OpenAI)
- Enter your goal (e.g. "I want to become an AI Engineer")
- Enter a timeframe (e.g. "6 months")

### Sample Output

```json
[
  {
    "step": "Learn Python basics",
    "priority": "High",
    "duration": "2 weeks",
    "resources": ["https://realpython.com", "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"],
    "depends_on": []
  },
  {
    "step": "Study Machine Learning fundamentals",
    "priority": "High",
    "duration": "4 weeks",
    "resources": ["Coursera ML by Andrew Ng", "Hands-On ML with Scikit-Learn"],
    "depends_on": ["Learn Python basics"]
  }
]
```

---

## Evaluation Logic

After decomposition, the result is **scored for faithfulness** using:

```python
retrieval_context = [
  "To become an AI Engineer, you typically need to learn Python, machine learning, deep learning, and build projects."
]
```

Evaluation is run using:

```python
FaithfulnessScorer(threshold=0.5)
```

And handled by:

```python
JudgmentClient.assert_test(...)
```

You‚Äôll see:

```bash
‚úÖ Evaluation passed successfully!
```
